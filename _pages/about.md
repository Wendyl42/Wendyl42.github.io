### About me

Iâ€™m Yihua Liu, an AI inference engineer. I worked for 2 years at [Wizard Quant](https://www.wizardquant.com/en), a well-known High-Frequency Trading firm in China. Previously I graduated from [Yuanpei College, Peking University](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/) with a bachelor's degree in Data Science and Big Data Technology.

I am mostly interested in Machine Learning Systems and their applications, including LLM optimization by Hardware-Software Co-Design. I am also passionate about efficient DNN computing, pruning and quantization.
